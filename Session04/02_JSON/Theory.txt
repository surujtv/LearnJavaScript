    What is JSON?
    The JavaScript JSON is an acronym of JavaScript Object Notation. It provides a format for storing and transporting data. It is a lightweight human readable collection of data that can be accessed in a logical manner.

    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it's a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans.

    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based data exchange format that is language-independent (can be use with any programming language). It is used in object-oriented programming to store and communicate data objects between applications.
    
    NOTE: it's not a programming language it's just a file formate to store data.

    Why we use JSON?

    Advantages-->
    -JSON is a lightweight as compared to XML.
    -It is easy for humans to read and write. 
    -It is easy for machines to parse and generate. 
    -It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language.

    Formate | Creating JSON-->
    The two primary parts that make up JSON are keys and values. Together they make a key/value pair.
    -Key: A key is always a string enclosed in double quote.
    -Value: A value can be a string, number, boolean expression, array, or object.
    -Key/Value Pair: A key value pair follows a specific syntax, with the key followed by a colon followed by the value. Key/value pairs are comma separated.
    Syntax-->
        {
            "student": {
                "name": "sandhya",
                "age": "24.5",
                "add": "indore"
                "skills": ['C', 'C++', 'MERN']
            }
        }

    NOTES: 
    1. JSON is replacement of XML.
    2. Keys & values must be double quoted.
    3. value can be any type of data.
    4. JSON supports dataStructures such as Array and Objects.
    5. It can be read and written in any programming language.
    6. JSON stores data in text format which can easily be transferred over network.
    7. JSON data parsed into JavaScript Objects using JSON.parse(json_file) method So browser's can easily understand JSON as JavaScript Objects.
    8. Comments are Not supported in JSON but we can do this by adding a key name as "comment": "write your comments here" this key will treated as a comment in JSON file.  
    9. Date objects and function are not allowed in JSON.
    10.If you need to include a date or function, write it as a string. You can convert it back into a date object or function later.
    11.Browser can't understand JSObject but can read JSON string.

    Difference between JSON & XML -->
    JSON is simpler than XML because it has fewer characters and does not require closing tags.
    In JSON, everything is an object (or a property) and everything is a string. There are no separate types like integers or floats
    In XML, every element needs to have both opening and closing tag whereas in JSON only need one.

    Creating JSON-->
    -Simple JSON.
    -Arrays Inside JSON.
    -Objects Inside JSON.
    -Nesting of Arrays and Objects in JSON.

    Methods to exchange JSON data on internet -->
    We have 2 most important methods that we will use while working with JSON-->

    1.  JSON.parse(json_sting) : Parsing a JSON string into JavaScript object.
        USE: while receiving data from server you will get the response in form of String.

    2.  JSON.stringify(obj)   : Converting JavaScript object into JSON String.
        USE: while sending data to server you will send the data in form of String.
