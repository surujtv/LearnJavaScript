    1. procedural programming (line bye line code)
    2. functional programming (function based programming)
    3. object-oriented programming (classes and object based programming)
    

    Four pillars of object oriented programming -

    1. Encapsulation - 
        grouping of components.
        Encapsulation can be defined as “the packing of data and functions into one component”. Packing, which is also known as bundling, grouping, and binding, simply means bringing together data and the methods that operate on data. The component can be a function, a class, or an object.

    2. Abstraction -
        Hiding complexity.
        Abstraction in OOPS is used to hide unnecessary information and display only necessary information to the users interacting. It is essential to represent real-world objects in a simplified manner for users to interact easily. For Example - car

    3. Inheritance
        -inherit something form parent (upgrade karna)
        Types of Inheritance:
        1.Single Level Inheritance:
            
        Class A(Parent,Base,Super) ==> Class B(Child,Derived,Subclass)

        ======================

        2.Multilevel Inheritance:

        Class A => Class B => Class C => Class D

        ======================

        3.Multiple Inheritance:It is not supported in Javascript only support in C++ and Python

            Class A   Class B 
                
                Class C 

        ======================

        4.Hierarchical Inheritance:
                    
                    Class A
            
            Class B           Class C
            
        Class D Class E   Class F Class G

        ========================

        5.Hybrid Inheritance:Combination of any two Inheritance (Multiple and Hierarchical).
        It is not supported in Javascript only support in C++ and Python

            Class A   Class B
            
                Class C
        
            Class D   Class E

    4. Polymorphism
        -single property with multiple usage.
